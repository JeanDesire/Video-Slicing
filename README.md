# Video-Slicing

In this project we have the data from Brightbots Bell Labs Mice recognition, where we have the data videos of three cameras folders which are D, F and G. we use the image slicer code to slice each of the three videos folders into one png image every one second per each video. After slicing the images I rename them in the format â€œCAM_D or F or G_Date_VideoNumber and then upload them to Box in their respective folders. In all this work I used Python programming language.

In the results we have seen that most of the videos have 10 seconds, means that in many our image folders we have 10 images with extension png.
